Note: running tests via 'python setup.py test' is now deprecated. The recommended method
is to run:

    tox -e test-alldeps

The Python version can also be specified, e.g.:

    tox -e py38-test-alldeps

You can list all available environments by doing:

    tox -a

If you don't already have tox installed, you can install it by doing:

    pip install tox

If you want to run all or part of the test suite within an existing environment,
you can use pytest directly:

    pip install -e .[dev]
    pytest
